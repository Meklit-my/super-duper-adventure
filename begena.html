        The begena, (Amharic: በገና) is a ten-stringed box-lyre instrument from
        Ethiopia, and is the sole melodic instrument devoted only to the zema,
        the spiritual part of Ethiopian music.The instrument's name is derived
        from bägänä, to buzz, pluck, play; it is etymologically related to the
        Hebrew , (nagan), "touch/play [a stringed instrument]"". Oral tradition
        identifies the instrument with the kinnor of the Israelites played by
        David to soothe King Saul's nerves and heal him of insomnia, and later
        brought to Africa by Menelik I. Its actual origin remains in doubt,
        though local manuscripts depict the instrument at the beginning of the
        15th century AD.
